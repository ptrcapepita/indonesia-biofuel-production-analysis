**Background**

With the varied disadvantages of fossil fuels to the environment and life forms (Bertrand, S., 2021),
it is vital for governments and industries to accommodate a substitute to this resource.
One of the approaches is to provide biofuels as an alternative of the conventional fuel.

**Objective**

The code has objective to implement the simple linear regression model to provides insight on how well Indonesia produced the biofuels. 
The data used in this code is from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/biofuel-production?source=post_page-----3e8e8d352e8f--------------------------------
